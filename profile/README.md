**Syncause** builds the next-generation **AI SRE Agent** — an intelligent system that detects, explains, and resolves incidents across complex distributed environments.
Our goal is to help engineers move faster, reduce noise, and make reliability observable, explainable, and automated.

### 🔍 What We Do

* **AI-Powered Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** — Find the true cause of incidents in minutes, not hours.
* **LLM Reasoning Transparency** — Every diagnosis includes a clear reasoning path that users can inspect and validate.
* **Integration with Observability Data** — Combine metrics, logs, traces, and [eBPF signals](https://syn-cause.com/blog/35e631d5-28fa-4c46-9f44-54f84707a2a4/) for higher RCA accuracy.
* **Continuous Learning** — Syncause evolves with your system, improving accuracy as more data and incidents are observed.

### 🚀 Why Syncause

Traditional AIOps tools rely on static models and manual tuning. Syncause takes a different approach — leveraging **Large Language Models (LLMs)** as reasoning engines that can dynamically interpret system behavior and propose evidence-based hypotheses.
This leads to:

* Faster mean-time-to-diagnosis (MTTD)
* Higher trust through interpretable outputs
* Reduced operational fatigue

### 📊 Open Benchmark & Evaluation

We believe that **AI SRE Agents must be transparent and measurable**.
In this GitHub organization, we openly share:

* **Evaluation results** of different AI models and algorithms
* **Benchmark reports** measuring accuracy, interpretability, and cost efficiency across test datasets
