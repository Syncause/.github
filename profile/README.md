Software breaks, not just at the code level, but across the systems that run it. When something goes wrong, engineers are left piecing together scattered clues: logs, metrics, traces, configs, and assumptions. Debugging becomes slow, painful, and costly.

Syncause exists to change that.

We're building an AI-powered debugging assistant that unifies **code debugging** and **system root cause analysis** into one seamless experience. By capturing deep runtime context and combining it with intelligent root cause reasoning, Syncause helps engineers instantly understand *why* failures happen before they escalate into incidents.

## What We Stand For

* **Debugging should be intelligent**  
  No more guesswork. Every failure leaves a trace; we make it visible and explainable.

* **Observability should be actionable**  
  Data alone isn't enough; insights must drive confident decisions.

* **Engineers should build, not firefight**  
  Debugging shouldn't be the bottleneck to shipping and scaling great products.

## What We Deliver

* Clear, contextual insights from code to infrastructure
* AI-driven root cause explanations you can trust
* Faster recovery and higher developer productivity
* Reduced user impact and operational stress

## Our Vision

To pioneer a new era of **autonomous debugging** where software understands itself well enough to help fix its own failures.

## Repository
### 📊 Open Benchmark & Evaluation

We believe that **AI SRE Agents must be transparent and measurable**.
In this GitHub organization, we openly share:

* **Evaluation results** of different AI models and algorithms
* **Benchmark reports** measuring accuracy, interpretability, and cost efficiency across test datasets
